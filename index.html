                        <p>Following the College Board's suggested curriculum designed to parallel college-level statistics courses, AP Statistics courses introduce students to the major concepts and tools for collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. Students are exposed to four broad conceptual themes: exploring data, sampling and experimentation, anticipating patterns, and statistical inference.<br></p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" role="button" target="_blank" href="./math-course-catalog/APStatistics.html">Sample Curriculum Guide AP Statistics

                        <p>Following the College Board’s suggested curriculum designed to parallel college-level calculus courses, AP Calculus AB provides students with an understanding of the concepts of calculus and experience with its methods and applications. These courses introduce calculus and include the following topics: functions, graphs, limits, and continuity; differential calculus (including definition, application, and computation of the derivative; derivative at a point; derivative as a function; and second derivatives); and integral calculus (including definite integrals and antidifferentiation).<br></p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" role="button" target="_blank" href="./math-course-catalog/APCalculus.html">Sample Curriculum Guide AP Calculus
